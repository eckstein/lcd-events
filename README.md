- `title` - The title to display above the events list (default: "Upcoming Events")

#### Examples

Display 3 upcoming events:
```
[lcd_events]
```

Display 5 upcoming events:
```
[lcd_events limit="5"]
```

Display 3 past events:
```
[lcd_events show_past="true" title="Past Events"]
```

Display events with no title:
```
[lcd_events show_title="false"]
```

### Volunteer Management

The plugin includes comprehensive volunteer management features:

1. **Volunteer Shifts**: Create multiple volunteer shifts for each event with different dates, times, and requirements
2. **Person Assignment**: Assign people from your contact database to specific shifts
3. **Guest Signups**: Track volunteer signups from people not in your database
4. **Export Functionality**: Export volunteer lists to CSV or PDF formats for printing or sharing
5. **Notes System**: Add specific notes for individual volunteer assignments

#### Accessing Volunteer Management

- **Single Event**: Edit any event and use the "Volunteer Shifts" meta box
- **Overview**: Navigate to Events â†’ Volunteer Shifts for a comprehensive view of all volunteer assignments

#### Exporting Volunteer Lists

You can export volunteer information in two formats:

- **CSV Export**: Perfect for importing into spreadsheet applications or databases
- **PDF Export**: Professional formatted documents suitable for printing or email distribution

Export options are available both from individual event edit pages and the volunteer shifts overview page.

## Customization

To override the default templates:

1. Create a folder called `lcd-events` in your theme directory
2. Create a `templates` folder inside the `lcd-events` folder
3. Copy the template files from the plugin's `templates` directory into your theme's `lcd-events/templates` directory
4. Modify the templates as needed

## Troubleshooting

If you experience 404 errors when trying to access the events archive page (/events/), try these steps:

1. Go to Settings > Permalinks in your WordPress admin
2. Click "Save Changes" without making any changes (this flushes rewrite rules)
3. Try accessing the events page again
